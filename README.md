## Gameplay

### Objective

Defend your base from waves of enemies by building and upgrading towers. Survive all waves to win.

### How to Play

1. **Select a Tower**  
   Use the bottom bar to choose a tower type. Each tower has unique abilities and cost.

2. **Place Towers**  
   Click on a highlighted placement tile to build the selected tower. You must have enough gold.

3. **Upgrade Towers**  
   Click on a placed tower to view its info and upgrade it (if you have enough gold). Upgrades improve damage, range, and fire rate.

4. **Start Waves**  
   Press the "Start Wave" button to begin a new wave of enemies. Some waves start automatically.

5. **Defend Your Base**  
   Enemies follow the path to your base. If they reach the end, you lose lives. Lose all lives and it's game over.

6. **Earn Gold**  
   Defeating enemies grants gold, which you use to build and upgrade towers.

### Tower Types

- **Basic Tower**: Standard single-target attack.
- **Area Effect Tower**: Deals splash damage to groups.
- **Slowing Tower**: Slows enemies on hit.
- **Sniper Tower**: High damage, long range, slow fire rate.
- **Multi-shot Tower**: Attacks multiple targets at once.
- **Support Tower**: Buffs nearby towers' fire rate.

### Enemy Types

- **Basic**: Standard enemy.
- **Fast**: Moves quickly, low health.
- **Armored**: High health, reduced damage taken.
- **Flying**: Ignores some tower types.
- **Boss**: Very high health, strong.

### Tips & Strategy

- Mix tower types for best coverage.
- Upgrade towers to handle tougher waves.
- Place support towers to maximize buffs.
- Watch your gold and plan upgrades carefully.
- Some towers can't hit flying enemiesâ€”plan accordingly.
