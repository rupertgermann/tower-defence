## Improved Button Positioning and Visibility (2025-04-18)

### Implemented Features
- Adjusted UI buttons to have a higher z-index (depth: 100) to ensure they appear above all other UI elements
- Moved buttons down slightly (from Y:20 to Y:30) to improve visibility and prevent overlap with the top bar background
- Improved code organization with a dedicated buttonY variable for easier future adjustments

### Encountered Errors
- Buttons were appearing behind the top bar background, making them difficult to see and interact with

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Set a higher depth value for the button container to control rendering order
- Adjusted vertical positioning to ensure buttons are properly visible

## Fixed Button Sizing in UI Button System (2025-04-18)

### Implemented Features
- Fixed button sizing issue in the UIButton helper class to properly resize large button images
- Improved hover and press effects to use consistent sizing approach with setDisplaySize()
- Enhanced the toggle state handling to maintain proper button size when switching images
- Updated the setSize() method to respect the current button state (hover/pressed)

### Encountered Errors
- Button images were not being properly resized despite setting display size
- Mixing scale and display size approaches was causing conflicts

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Removed redundant scale application after setting display size
- Changed all hover/press effects to use setDisplaySize() instead of setScale()
- Ensured proper size maintenance when toggling between different button states

## Implemented Unified UI Button System (2025-04-18)

### Implemented Features
- Created a reusable `UIButton` helper class in `src/helpers/UIButton.js` with support for tooltips, toggle functionality, and visual feedback
- Created a `ConfirmationDialog` helper class in `src/helpers/ConfirmationDialog.js` for action confirmations
- Refactored UIScene.js to use the new button system:
  - Replaced emoji-based mute button with image-based implementation using the new assets
  - Added restart button with confirmation dialog
  - Added main menu button with confirmation dialog
  - Implemented proper button state management based on game state
  - Added cleanup logic to prevent memory leaks

### Encountered Errors
- Module resolution errors due to missing .js extensions in import statements
- Asset path issues when loading button images

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Added .js extensions to imports for helper classes
- Fixed asset paths to match the project's existing asset loading convention
- Implemented proper cleanup in the shutdown method to prevent memory leaks

## Entity Management Refactor Checklist Added (2025-04-17)

### Implemented Features
- Added a comprehensive, actionable checklist for "1. Entity Management Refactor" to `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
- The checklist covers: replacing manual arrays with Phaser Groups, implementing object pooling, updating entity creation/destruction, refactoring collision logic, updating related managers, thorough testing, and documentation/code cleanup.

### Encountered Errors
- No errors encountered during checklist creation or file update.

### How Issues Were Fixed
- N/A (no issues arose)

---

This update provides a clear roadmap for the entity management refactor, ensuring all steps are tracked and nothing is missed during implementation.

## Fixed 'undefined is not iterable' crash in SupportTower (2025-04-17)

### Implemented Features
- Updated `SupportTower.applyBuff` to iterate over `this.scene.towerManager.getAll()` instead of `this.scene.towers`.
- Added a guard to ensure `towerManager` exists before iterating, preventing runtime crashes if the manager is missing.

### Encountered Errors
- Game would crash after some time with: `TypeError: undefined is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))` in `SupportTower.applyBuff`.
- Root cause: `this.scene.towers` was undefined, as towers are managed via `TowerManager`.

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Changed the iteration to use the correct tower source: `this.scene.towerManager.getAll()`.
- Added a fallback to an empty array if `towerManager` is missing, ensuring safe iteration.
