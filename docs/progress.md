## Entity Management Refactor Checklist Added (2025-04-17)

### Implemented Features
- Added a comprehensive, actionable checklist for "1. Entity Management Refactor" to `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
- The checklist covers: replacing manual arrays with Phaser Groups, implementing object pooling, updating entity creation/destruction, refactoring collision logic, updating related managers, thorough testing, and documentation/code cleanup.

### Encountered Errors
- No errors encountered during checklist creation or file update.

### How Issues Were Fixed
- N/A (no issues arose)

---

This update provides a clear roadmap for the entity management refactor, ensuring all steps are tracked and nothing is missed during implementation.

## Fixed 'undefined is not iterable' crash in SupportTower (2025-04-17)

### Implemented Features
- Updated `SupportTower.applyBuff` to iterate over `this.scene.towerManager.getAll()` instead of `this.scene.towers`.
- Added a guard to ensure `towerManager` exists before iterating, preventing runtime crashes if the manager is missing.

### Encountered Errors
- Game would crash after some time with: `TypeError: undefined is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))` in `SupportTower.applyBuff`.
- Root cause: `this.scene.towers` was undefined, as towers are managed via `TowerManager`.

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Changed the iteration to use the correct tower source: `this.scene.towerManager.getAll()`.
- Added a fallback to an empty array if `towerManager` is missing, ensuring safe iteration.

## Step: Unified UI Button Refactor (per button_refactoring_plan.md)

### Implemented Features
- Created a reusable UIButton class (src/ui/UIButton.js) for all UI buttons (mute, restart, main menu), handling icons, tooltips, interactivity, toggling, enabling/disabling, and visual feedback.
- Created a reusable ConfirmationDialog class (src/ui/ConfirmationDialog.js) for modal overlays used by restart and main menu actions.
- Refactored UIScene.js to use UIButton and ConfirmationDialog for mute, restart, and main menu buttons, grouped in a responsive top-right container.
- Added enable/disable logic for these buttons based on game/dialog state.
- Documented the need for assets (mute.png, unmute.png, restart.png, mainmenu.png) in public/assets/ui/ (README.txt added as placeholder/reminder).
- Created dummy files for missing UI button icons: mute.png, unmute.png, restart.png, mainmenu.png in public/assets/ui/. These are empty placeholder PNG files to ensure the game loads without asset errors until real graphics are provided.
- Fixed UI button z-index: Set a high depth (10000) for the topRightButtonsContainer in UIScene.js, ensuring the unified UI buttons are always above the board and tower placement buttons. This resolves the issue where clicking UI buttons would place towers instead.

### Encountered Errors
- The required UI icon assets (mute, unmute, restart, mainmenu) are missing in public/assets/ui/. Placeholder logic is in place, but icons must be added for full visual compliance.

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Proceeded with logic and refactor, leaving clear instructions and a placeholder for asset addition. All code is modular and ready for asset drop-in.
