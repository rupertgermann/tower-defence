## Progress Log

## Victory Banner Implementation

- **Implemented Features**: Added a victory banner in `GameScene.js` that displays when all waves are successfully defended. The banner includes a semi-transparent background, 'VICTORY!' text in gold, and instructions to click to return to the main menu. A `gameEnded` flag was also added to prevent multiple banners from showing.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - Created a dedicated `showVictoryBanner()` method in GameScene.js
  - Added a semi-transparent black background covering 60% of the game width and 40% of the height
  - Implemented gold-colored 'VICTORY!' text with black stroke for better visibility
  - Added white instruction text "Click to return to main menu"
  - Set up click handler to return to the map select scene
  - Added animation effects: victory text scales in, instruction text fades in with delay
  - Implemented gameEnded flag to prevent multiple banners from appearing
- **Encountered Errors**: Previously faced syntax errors due to an unterminated string literal in the victory banner text caused by an improper line break.
- **Fixes Applied**: Corrected the syntax error by properly escaping the line break in the string, resolving all related lint errors.

## HMR Bug Fix in Webpack Config

- **Implemented Features**: Fixed the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) error by updating the webpack configuration.
- **Encountered Errors**: Error message 'HMR is not implemented for module chunk format yet' appeared on the command line after code changes.
- **Fixes Applied**: Removed the `experiments.outputModule` setting from `webpack.config.js` as it was conflicting with HMR functionality.
