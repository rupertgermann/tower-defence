  - Replaced emoji-based mute button with image-based implementation using the new assets
  - Added restart button with confirmation dialog
  - Added main menu button with confirmation dialog
  - Implemented proper button state management based on game state
  - Added cleanup logic to prevent memory leaks

### Encountered Errors

## Fixed 'undefined is not iterable' crash in SupportTower (2025-04-17)

### Implemented Features
- Updated `SupportTower.applyBuff` to iterate over `this.scene.towerManager.getAll()` instead of `this.scene.towers`.
- Added a guard to ensure `towerManager` exists before iterating, preventing runtime crashes if the manager is missing.

### Encountered Errors
- Game would crash after some time with: `TypeError: undefined is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))` in `SupportTower.applyBuff`.
- Root cause: `this.scene.towers` was undefined, as towers are managed via `TowerManager`.

### How Issues Were Fixed
- Changed the iteration to use the correct tower source: `this.scene.towerManager.getAll()`.
- Added a fallback to an empty array if `towerManager` is missing, ensuring safe iteration.
