### Core Technologies
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3.88.2
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Build System**: Webpack 5
- **Module Format**: ES Modules
- **Asset Pipeline**: Custom asset generator script

### Development Environment
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Transpiler**: Babel
- **Development Server**: Webpack Dev Server
- **Asset Handling**: Copy Webpack Plugin, HTML Webpack Plugin

## Technical Architecture

```

### Build Pipeline
1. Webpack processes the entry point (src/index.js)
2. Babel transpiles ES6+ code to browser-compatible JavaScript
3. Assets are copied to the build directory
4. HTML is generated with proper script references
5. Development server serves the built files with hot reloading

## Key Technical Components

### Phaser Game Engine
The game leverages Phaser 3's key features:
- **Scene Management**: Multiple scenes for game and UI
- **Physics System**: Arcade physics for movement and collisions
- **Game Objects**: Sprites, containers, and graphics primitives
- **Animation System**: For visual effects and entity animations
- **Event System**: For communication between components
- **Input Handling**: Mouse/touch input for tower placement and UI

### Rendering Approach
- Canvas-based rendering via Phaser's WebGL renderer
- Sprite-based entities with dynamic transformations
- Layered rendering with z-index management
- Particle effects for visual feedback

### Game Loop Implementation
The game uses Phaser's built-in game loop with:
- Fixed time step updates
- Delta-time based movement calculations
- Scene-specific update methods
- Entity-level update methods

## Asset Management

### Asset Types
- **Sprites**: PNG images for towers, enemies, projectiles
- **Tiles**: Map tiles for background, path, and placement areas
- **UI Elements**: Buttons, panels, and indicators
- **Effects**: Explosion and hit effects

### Asset Generation
The project includes a custom asset generator script (`assets-generator.js`) that:
- Creates placeholder assets during development
- Ensures consistent sizing and formatting
- Generates variations of base assets

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- **Object Pooling**: Planned for projectiles and effects
- **Render Culling**: Only rendering on-screen entities
- **Efficient Collision Detection**: Using spatial partitioning (planned)
- **Asset Optimization**: Properly sized and compressed images

### Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: 60 FPS with full visual effects
- **Mobile**: 30 FPS with potential reduction in particle effects
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for core game assets and logic

## Browser Compatibility

### Target Browsers
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+
- Mobile browsers with WebGL support

### Fallbacks
- Canvas renderer fallback when WebGL is unavailable
- Reduced particle effects on lower-end devices
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Development Workflow

### Build Commands
- `npm start`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Create production build
- `npm run generate-assets`: Run asset generation script

### Development Practices
- Modular code organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- JSDoc comments for API documentation
- Encapsulation of game systems in manager classes

## Future Technical Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- **Asset Loading Optimization**: Progressive loading and caching
- **Mobile Touch Controls**: Enhanced touch input for mobile devices
- **Performance Profiling**: Identifying and addressing bottlenecks
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of non-critical game components
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests for core game systems
