# Tower Defense Game Active Context

_Last Memory Bank Review: 12.4.2025, 18:49 (Europe/Berlin) â€” All memory bank files reviewed and current._

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently in the implementation phase of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The core architecture and systems have been established, and the focus is now on completing the remaining game mechanics and integrating all components into a fully playable game.

## Recent Developments

### Completed
- Project setup with Webpack and Babel configuration
- Core game architecture with scene management
- Implementation of base entity classes (Tower, Enemy, Projectile)
- Path system for enemy movement
- Tower placement system on designated tiles
- Asset generation for placeholder graphics
- Wave management system for spawning enemies
- Basic enemy AI with path following
- Collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Economy system for resource management

### In Progress
- Game testing and balancing
- Visual feedback for game events
- Tower special abilities (AoE damage, slowing effect)
- Enemy variety implementation (flying, armored types)

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring smooth performance with many entities on screen
- Balancing game difficulty across waves
- Implementing proper collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Handling special cases like flying enemies and area effects

### Recent Bug Fixes
- Fixed errors that occurred when enemies were killed:
  1. `this.data.destroy is not a function` error
     - Root cause: Phaser's GameObject.destroy() method attempts to destroy all properties that have a destroy method
     - Solution: Added a custom destroy() method to the Enemy class that sets data to null before calling the parent destroy method
  
  2. `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'economyManager')` error
     - Root cause: The reference to scene was lost in the tween's onComplete callback after the enemy was destroyed
     - Solution: Stored references to scene and economyManager in local variables before setting up the tween

### Design Challenges
- Tuning tower and enemy parameters for balanced gameplay
- Creating intuitive UI for tower selection and placement
- Providing clear visual feedback for game events
- Ensuring the difficulty curve is appropriate

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete game testing and balancing
2. Implement visual and audio feedback for game events
3. Finalize tower special abilities
4. Complete enemy variety implementation

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement game state management (win/lose conditions)
2. Begin Phase 1 of the expansion plan:
   - Implement tower upgrading functionality
   - Enhance visual effects
   - Add sound effects and music

### Medium-term Goals
1. Continue with Phase 2 of the expansion plan:
   - Add additional tower types
   - Create multiple maps with different layouts
   - Implement enemy special abilities

### Long-term Goals
1. Implement Phase 3 and 4 features:
   - Meta-progression system
   - Save/load functionality
   - Tutorial system
   - Performance optimization
   - Special abilities and power-ups

## Decision Log

### Recent Decisions
- **Tower Types**: Limited to three distinct types (Basic, AoE, Slow) for MVP to ensure clear differentiation and balanced gameplay
- **Enemy Movement**: Implemented segment-based path following for smooth movement along predefined paths
- **Wave System**: Designed progressive wave system with increasing difficulty and enemy variety
- **UI Layout**: Created separate UI scene overlaid on game scene for cleaner architecture
- **Bug Fixes**: Implemented custom destroy method in Enemy class to prevent errors during enemy destruction
- **Expansion Plan**: Created a comprehensive four-phase expansion plan to add features beyond the MVP

### Pending Decisions
- How to handle tower upgrades (branching paths vs. linear progression)
- Visual effects for different tower attacks and enemy deaths
- Implementation of sound effects and background music
- Approach for saving game progress
- Resource allocation for expansion plan implementation

## Integration Points

### Critical Integration Points
- **Tower-Enemy Interaction**: Towers need to target and damage enemies
- **Wave-Economy System**: Defeating enemies provides resources for tower placement
- **UI-Game Interaction**: Player actions in UI need to affect game state
- **Path-Enemy Connection**: Enemies need to follow the defined paths

### Testing Focus
- Tower targeting and firing mechanics
- Enemy path following and health management
- Wave progression and enemy spawning
- Resource management and tower placement
- Game balance and difficulty progression
