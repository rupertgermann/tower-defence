## Progress Log

### Task 1.1 - Extract common utilities into `/src/utils/`
- **Implemented Features**: Created `src/utils/math.js` with math helpers (`distance`, `lerp`, `angleBetween`) and refactored `PathManager.js` to use these utilities.
- **Encountered Errors**: None.
- **Fixes Applied**: N/A.

### Victory Banner Implementation

- **Implemented Features**: Added a victory banner in `GameScene.js` that displays when all waves are successfully defended. The banner includes a semi-transparent background, 'VICTORY!' text in gold, and instructions to click to return to the main menu. A `gameEnded` flag was also added to prevent multiple banners from showing.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - Created a dedicated `showVictoryBanner()` method in GameScene.js
  - Added a semi-transparent black background covering 60% of the game width and 40% of the height
  - Implemented gold-colored 'VICTORY!' text with black stroke for better visibility
  - Added white instruction text "Click to return to main menu"
  - Set up click handler to return to the map select scene
  - Added animation effects: victory text scales in, instruction text fades in with delay
  - Implemented gameEnded flag to prevent multiple banners from appearing
- **Encountered Errors**: Previously faced syntax errors due to an unterminated string literal in the victory banner text caused by an improper line break.
- **Fixes Applied**: Corrected the syntax error by properly escaping the line break in the string, resolving all related lint errors.

### HMR Bug Fix in Webpack Config

- **Implemented Features**: Fixed the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) error by updating the webpack configuration.
- **Encountered Errors**: Error message 'HMR is not implemented for module chunk format yet' appeared on the command line after code changes.
- **Fixes Applied**: Removed the `experiments.outputModule` setting from `webpack.config.js` as it was conflicting with HMR functionality.

### Task 1.2 - Convert Scenes & Entities to ES6 modules
- **Implemented Features**: Converted each Scene and Entity to ES6 modules with proper `import`/`export` statements and updated all import paths.
- **Encountered Errors**: None.
- **Fixes Applied**: Ensured consistent module structure and file naming.

### Task 1.3 - Introduce EventEmitter utility
- **Implemented Features**: Created `src/utils/EventEmitter.js`; refactored Tower and UIScene to use global emitter for `showTowerInfo` events.
- **Encountered Errors**: None.
- **Fixes Applied**: N/A.

### Task 1.4 - Externalize configuration data
- **Implemented Features**: Moved towers, waves, extra waves into JSON under `/src/assets/config` and maps into `/public/maps`; updated `index.js` to import JSON configs and MapManager to load maps.
- **Encountered Errors**: None.
- **Fixes Applied**: Updated code to reference JSON configurations.

### Task 1.5 - Fix tower info panel listener context
- **Implemented Features**: Bound `showTowerInfo` listener via arrow function in UIScene.js to preserve scene this context.
- **Encountered Errors**: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'towerInfoPanel') when selecting a tower.
- **Fixes Applied**: Updated `emitter.on('showTowerInfo', ...)` to use `(tower) => this.showTowerInfo(tower)` ensuring `this.towerInfoPanel` is defined correctly.

### GameScene Complexity Reduction (2025-04-17)
- **Implemented Features**: Added a detailed, actionable task list to `docs/implementation-plan.md` under section 7, outlining the process for reducing complexity in `GameScene.js` by extracting complex logic into helper modules/classes and integrating them back into the scene.
- **Encountered Errors**: No errors encountered during this documentation update step.
- **How Errors Were Fixed**: N/A

### GameScene Complexity Reduction: Collision & Effect Logic Modularized (2025-04-17)
- **Implemented Features**: Extracted collision handling into `CollisionManager.js` and effect spawning into `EffectSpawner.js`. Updated `GameScene.js` to use these helpers, removed redundant methods, and delegated responsibilities accordingly. All logic for projectile-enemy collisions and hit/explosion effects is now modularized.
- **Encountered Errors**: No errors encountered during refactor and extraction.
- **How Errors Were Fixed**: N/A

### Event System Standardization Checklist & Audit (2025-04-17)
- **Implemented Features**: Added an implementation checklist for Event System Standardization to `docs/implementation-plan.md`. Audited the codebase and confirmed all custom emitter usages and the utility file are removed. All events now use Phaser’s event system, with code comments clarifying event usage.
- **Encountered Errors**: No errors encountered during audit and checklist implementation.
- **How Errors Were Fixed**: N/A
