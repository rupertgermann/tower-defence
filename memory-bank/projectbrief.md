# Tower Defense Game Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive tower defense game built with Phaser 3, featuring strategic gameplay where players defend against waves of enemies by strategically placing and upgrading towers. The game follows the classic tower defense formula while implementing a clean architecture and modern web technologies.

## Core Objectives
- Create a fully functional tower defense game with engaging gameplay
- Implement a variety of tower types with different abilities
- Design diverse enemy types with unique characteristics
- Develop a wave-based progression system
- Build an intuitive user interface for game interaction
- Establish a solid foundation for future expansion

## Technical Requirements
- **Engine**: Phaser 3.88.2
- **Build System**: Webpack 5
- **Target Performance**: 60 FPS on desktop, 30 FPS on mobile
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 (scalable)
- **Asset Format**: PNG images

## Game Features

### Tower Types
- **Basic Tower**: Standard attack tower with balanced stats
- **Area of Effect (AoE) Tower**: Damages multiple enemies in a radius
- **Slowing Tower**: Reduces enemy movement speed temporarily

### Enemy Types
- **Basic Enemy**: Standard enemy with balanced stats
- **Fast Enemy**: Moves quickly but has less health
- **Armored Enemy**: High health and damage resistance
- **Flying Enemy**: Can only be targeted by certain towers
- **Boss Enemy**: Extremely powerful enemy that appears in the final wave

### Game Mechanics
- Path-based enemy movement system
- Tower placement on designated tiles
- Wave-based enemy spawning
- Economy system with gold earned from defeating enemies
- Lives system where enemies reaching the end reduce player lives
- Tower targeting and projectile physics

## Development Approach
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Scenes**: Game and UI scenes for rendering and interaction
- **Entities**: Tower, Enemy, and Projectile classes
- **Systems**: PathManager, WaveManager, and EconomyManager

## Current Implementation Status
The project has implemented the core gameplay mechanics:
- Tower placement and targeting system
- Enemy path following and health management
- Wave-based progression system
- Economy system for resource management
- Basic UI for game interaction

The focus is now on refining these systems, balancing gameplay, and adding visual and audio feedback to enhance the player experience.

## MVP Scope
The Minimum Viable Product includes:
- 3 Tower Types (Basic, AoE, Slow)
- 5 Enemy Types (Basic, Fast, Armored, Flying, Boss)
- Single map with defined path
- 10 progressive waves of increasing difficulty
- Basic economy and lives system
- Core gameplay loop with victory/defeat conditions

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Additional tower types and upgrade paths
- Multiple maps with different layouts
- Special abilities and power-ups
- Meta-progression between games
- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- Sound effects and background music
- Tutorial or help system
- Save/load functionality

## Development Timeline
The project is currently in the implementation phase of the MVP. The core architecture and systems have been established, and the focus is now on completing the remaining game mechanics and integrating all components into a fully playable game.

### Completed
- Project setup and build configuration
- Core game architecture with scene management
- Implementation of base entity classes
- Path system for enemy movement
- Tower placement system on designated tiles
- Wave management system for enemy spawning
- Basic enemy AI with path following
- Collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Economy system for resource management

### In Progress
- Game testing and balancing
- Visual feedback for game events
- Tower special abilities refinement
- Enemy variety implementation

### Next Steps
- Complete game testing and balancing
- Implement visual and audio feedback
- Finalize tower special abilities
- Complete enemy variety implementation
- Implement game state management (win/lose conditions)
