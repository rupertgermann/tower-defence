# Tower Defense Game Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive tower defense game built with Phaser 3, featuring strategic gameplay where players defend against waves of enemies by strategically placing and upgrading towers. The game follows the classic tower defense formula while implementing a clean architecture and modern web technologies.

## Core Objectives
- Create a fully functional tower defense game with engaging gameplay
- Implement a variety of tower types with different abilities
- Design diverse enemy types with unique characteristics
- Develop a wave-based progression system
- Build an intuitive user interface for game interaction
- Establish a solid foundation for future expansion

## Technical Requirements
- **Engine**: Phaser 3.88.2
- **Build System**: Webpack 5
- **Target Performance**: 60 FPS on desktop, 30 FPS on mobile
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 (scalable)
- **Asset Format**: PNG images

## Game Features

### Tower Types
- **Basic Tower**: Standard attack tower with balanced stats
- **Area of Effect (AoE) Tower**: Damages multiple enemies in a radius
- **Slowing Tower**: Reduces enemy movement speed temporarily

### Enemy Types
- **Basic Enemy**: Standard enemy with balanced stats
- **Fast Enemy**: Moves quickly but has less health
- **Armored Enemy**: High health and damage resistance
- **Flying Enemy**: Can only be targeted by certain towers
- **Boss Enemy**: Extremely powerful enemy that appears in the final wave

### Game Mechanics
- Path-based enemy movement system
- Tower placement on designated tiles
- Wave-based enemy spawning
- Economy system with gold earned from defeating enemies
- Lives system where enemies reaching the end reduce player lives
- Tower targeting and projectile physics

## Development Approach
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Scenes**: Game and UI scenes for rendering and interaction
- **Entities**: Tower, Enemy, and Projectile classes
- **Systems**: PathManager, WaveManager, and EconomyManager

## MVP Scope
The Minimum Viable Product includes:
- 3 Tower Types (Basic, AoE, Slow)
- 5 Enemy Types (Basic, Fast, Armored, Flying, Boss)
- Single map with defined path
- 10 progressive waves of increasing difficulty
- Basic economy and lives system
- Core gameplay loop with victory/defeat conditions

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Additional tower types and upgrade paths
- Multiple maps with different layouts
- Special abilities and power-ups
- Meta-progression between games
- Enhanced visual effects and animations
